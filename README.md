======================

Java version of the CP1200 2014 SP1 Assignment

This file should be useful to see similarities and differences between Python and Java.

The repository contains two Java files:
V1 - assignment 1 (simple game)
V2 - assignment 2 (more advanced game, including the part 2 Class requirement)

Python 'original' files are also included in the Python folder to facilitate comparison 
(you might like to open the Python and Java files side-by-side in your IDE)
